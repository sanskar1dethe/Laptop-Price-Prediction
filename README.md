## Introduction
The pricing of laptops can be influenced by various factors, such as specifications, brand, market trends, and consumer demand. This project leverages data analysis and machine learning techniques to predict laptop prices based on historical data, enabling users to make informed decisions when purchasing or selling laptops.

## Technologies Used
* Python
* Libraries: Seaborn, Matplotlib, Pandas, Scikit Learn

## Project Overview
1. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Analyzed the dataset to gain insights into laptop price distribution, relationships between features, and potential data outliers.
2. Data Cleaning and Preprocessing: Prepared the dataset for model training by handling missing values, scaling numerical features, and encoding categorical variables.
3. Model Development: Utilized different machine learning algorithms, including Linear Regression, Support Vector Regressor, Decision tree regressor, and Random Forest Regressor, to build and train the prediction model.
4. Model Evaluation: Evaluated the performance of each model using appropriate metrics and selected the best-performing model for deployment.
